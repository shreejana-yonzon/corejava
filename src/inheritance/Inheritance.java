 * ------------------Inheritance-------------
 *  #use for code re-useability.
 *  # there must be 2 classes.
 *  #process of accessing properties and method of parent/super/base class to 
 *    child/sub/derived class is known as inheritance.
 *    
 *  # Also known as IS-A relationship.
 *  # Its a generalization to specialization process.
 *  # We can inherit only one class at a time.
 *  # We can't inherit private properties, methods and constructors.
 *  # 'extends' keyword is used in inheritance.
 *  # Multiple inheritance not supported in java in class level but 
 *    supports in interface.
 *    
 *    # Syntax:
 *    
 *      child_class extends parent_class{
 *      
 *      //properties: parent + child
 *      
 *      //methods : parent + child
 *      
 *      e.g
 *      
 *      class A{
 *      
 *      }
 *      
 *      class B extends A{
 *      
 *      }
 *      
 *      //yasma class B ko properties aauxa
 *      class C extends B{
 *      
 *      }
 *
