 * --------------Constructor-------------------
 *  # use to create object in java.
 *  # special type of method which has same name as class name is called constructor.
 *  
 *  #if there is no any user defined constructor in class then java provides default constructor.
 *  
 *  #Constructor does not have return type.
 *  
 *  #Types of Constructor:
 *  
 *   a> default constructor:
 *   -> use to create object and set default values to it.
 *   
 *     syntax:
 *       class_name(){
 *       
 *       //set default values to object
 *       
 *       }
 *       
 *   b>parameterized constructor:
 *    ->use to create object and set dynamic values to it.
 *    
 *      syntax:
 *      
 *      class_name(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,..........,argn){
 *      
 *         //set dynamic values to object.
 *      }
 *      
 *      
 *      instance is dependent on object whereas static is dependent on class.
 *      If the value is sharable then it is called static/class variable.800bits-8bits memory management.Static value may change.
